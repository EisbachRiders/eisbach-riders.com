Surfboard fins come in different sizes and shapes to suit your personal surfing style. For the most common thruster fin setup with three fins, you can choose between small, medium and large fins. Bigger fins equal more hold, as more surface area is in contact with the water. Smaller ones create a “looser” feel.

We recommend the following sizes:

## Future Plug System

Small - G3: surfer weighing 48 to 70 kg (105-155 lbs)

Medium - G5: surfer weighing 66 to 88 kg (145-195 lbs)

Large - G7: surfer weighing over 82 kg (over 180 lbs)

## FCS 1 Plug System

Small - G3: surfer weighing 54 to 70 kg (120-155 lbs)

Medium - G5: surfer weighing 65 to 80 kg (143-176 lbs)

Large - G7: surfer weighing over 75 kg (over 165 lbs)

If you are in between sizes, you should consider the type and size of waves and the board you will be surfing.
