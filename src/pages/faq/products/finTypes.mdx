The main difference (between the commonly used materials nylon and fiberglass) is the resulting flexibility or stiffness of the fin.

**Nylon fins** are the most common found and are an affordable option for beginners or river surfing. We offer two types of nylon fins; super flex and moderate stiffness. Our super flex fins are very flexiable and feel rubbery to the touch. They are extrememly durable and are very unlikely to break or break your fin plug. The tradeoff for durability is that, as they are flexible, they offer less support. However, they perfectly suited for beginners and for making turns with a larger radius. Our modern stiffness fins (the surf essential line) will give you more response during turn. While stiffer fins in general are more likely to break, our fins are designed to break above the tab so not to destroy the fin plug.

**Fiberglass fins** are made of fiberglass tissue filled with resin. They are stiffer than the nylon fins and give the opportunity for sharp cutbacks and speed generation. The fiberglass fins are bit heavier than nylon fins.

**Honeycomb fiberglass fins** are a lightweight version of the fiberglass fins with a honeycomb core.
