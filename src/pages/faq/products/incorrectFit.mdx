The process to build a surfboard is a craft and there are sometimes smaller tolerances between the different fin setups and surfboard shapes. This can occur for boards with separate FCS I plugs for each fin tab, since they are positioned in the surfboard using a template fin that could deviate from the standard. For FCS I Sana, Future or FCS II plugs this issue should not occur. If you find that your fin does not fit, you can of course return your fin and we would be happy to try and help find you something better for your board!
