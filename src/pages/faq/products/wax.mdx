Surf wax is used for getting a grip on the slippery surfboard surface. One bar usually coats a complete longboard with 10-12 ft. Depending on the water temperature different wax mixtures should be used:

• Grip-Bee is the extra grippy cold water wax (58°F / 14°C and below). This wax is perfect for cold-water river and wake surfing.

• Hana Hou is the tropical wax (70°F / 21°C and warmer). This wax can also be used as a base coat in cooler temp water.
