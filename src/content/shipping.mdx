## Shipping

All orders above 15 Euro are free of charge within Germany. For smaller orders, we charge a flat rate of 3 Euro shipping costs (including VAT). Usually, we ship the orders within 24h with the Deutsche Post or Hermes. Orders above 50 Euro are shipped insured.

Outside of German and within Europe, we charge an additional flat fee of 4 Euro. For other countries, please contact us. Please remember: for shipping outside the European Union, you have to take care of import tax and duty.

Please make sure that the delivery address is correct. We are not responsible for errors or misdeliveries if the delivery address is incorrect.

If you have the option to come to Munich, you can pick up your order directly from our warehouse after prior arrangement.
