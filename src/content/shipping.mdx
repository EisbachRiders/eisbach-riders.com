### Germany

All orders above 15 Euro are free of charge within Germany. For smaller orders, we charge a flat rate of 3 Euro shipping costs (including VAT). Usually, we ship the orders within 24h with the Deutsche Post or Hermes. Orders above 50 Euro are shipped insured.

Please make sure that the delivery address is correct. We are not responsible for errors or misdeliveries if the delivery address is incorrect.

### International

Outside of German and within Europe, we charge a flat fee of 5 Euro. For other countries, please contact us. Please remember: for shipping outside the European Union, you have to take care of import tax and duty.

### Local Pick-Up in Munich
