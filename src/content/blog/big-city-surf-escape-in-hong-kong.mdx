If you are on a trip to Asia and have the opportunity to see Hong Kong we cannot recommend it enough, even if you are just trying to make the most out of a layout, you won't be disappointed. While the city is pulsing with life, just a short trip outside the city and you are suprised with nature and beaches. A very unique mixture. When I’m in Hong Kong I always stay at Hong Kong Island. Most of the beaches are on the south side of the island. Helpful hint, expect to take the bus to the south side of the island because the MTR System mainly operates on the north side of the island.

The most popular surf sport is called Big Wave Bay beside this one there are other surf spots like Shek O Beach or Repulse Bay. I went to the Big Wave Bay after taking the MTR Blue Line I changed to a Mini Buss, Linie 9 torwads Shek O Beach. As far as I know you can also go by MTR to Shau Kei Wan station and then take the public Mini Buss.

## Big Wave Bay Surf Spot

The current surf conditions and forecast for the Big Wave Surf spot you can find [here](https://magicseaweed.com/Big-Wave-Bay-HK-Surf-Report/1163/ "Magic Seaweed Big Wave Bay Surfspot Hong Kong"). You can rent surfboards from 40 to 60 HKD. There are 2 to 3 shops which are selling and renting surf equipment. As closer as you get to the beach as higher gets the board rent. So my tip rent a board in the first shop when you are coming down the hill from the parking lot. It’s located on the left side. They also rent wetsuits but honestly the water was so warm that you not really need it but of course this depends on the season. I went there on the beginning of May. There are facilities for shower as well as changing rooms directly down on the beach. The spot is a beach breaker but on the left on right side are some Rocks. In some areas also under water which you can’t see from above so be careful. When I was there it was quite bumpy and the conditions maybe not so good for beginners but I heard in summer there should be better conditions. Nevertheless, it is a perfect escape from the big city live.

Good Swell!
