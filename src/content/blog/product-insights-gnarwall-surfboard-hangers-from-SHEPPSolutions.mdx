In this piece of our Product Insights, we would like to introduce our Canadian partner, SHEPPSolutions. We discovered the **[hidden surfbaord hangers](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/surfboard-wall-rack/)** in 2018 during their Kickstarter campaign and after hanging up our first board and we were instantly hooked (eh, eh). In the following interview, Adam Shepperdley, founder of **[SHEPPSolutions](https://sheppsolutions.com/)**, tells us a bit more about their products.

## Who is the team behind the brand SHEPPSolutions?

SHEPPSolutions is led by **Adam Shepperdley**, the creator and owner. The team consists of **Terrence** and **Abdul** who are Industrial Designers that work for his Design Consultancy business called SHEPP iD.

SHEPPSolutions just hired a full-time shop assistant to manufacture, assemble, package and ship their products. **Andre** is doing great so far, offloading work from the core team so that they can concentrate on developing new products. They also recently hired **Eugenia** who will be focusing on Sales and Marketing, website upgrades and Social Media content.

## How did you come up with your idea of the hidden surfboard hangers?

The entire idea started with Adam moving his Industrial Design Consultancy - SHEPP Industrial Design Inc. (SHEPP iD) into a new lofty office space. Adam had a massive white wall surrounding his standing desk 16' high and 30' wide. He thought it would be a perfect place to hang his favorite boards.

The first version was a huge candy-cane shape that hooked onto black plumbing pipe that he got from the hardware store. He loved the **boards hanging upside down**, but hated seeing the black pipe on the wall. After many iterations he invented a [simple wall hanger and miniature hooks system](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/surfboard-wall-rack/). Presto!

The boards look like they are floating on the wall. After showing the idea to some friends and getting great response on social media, he decided to launch a **Kickstarter campaign**. The campaign was successful, and the rest is history.

From that initial idea spawned a [snowboard wall mount](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/snowboard-wall-rack/), [multi board wall racks](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/multi-board-rack/), plant hangers, a [wetsuit hanger](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/wetsuit-hanger/) and a wetsuit Drip/Dry rack.

## How are your products produced?

For the most part our products are produced in the **SHEPPSolutions shop** and cut with a laser. The custom plastic wall hanger are made from 100% **recyclable ABS plastic** (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) . The custom screws are **stainless steel** so they will never rust.

For all of our wooden parts, they use the highest grade [**Russian Baltic Birch Plywood**](http://blog.patriottimber.com/5-benefits-of-choosing-birch-plywood-for-your-home-improvement-needs/). This is a great material, as it is commonly known for its strength and stability. Three or more layers of Birch are combined together to make a single sheet of plywood, reinforcing the strength of the original piece of wood. Furthermore, it's extremely sustainable, as Birch trees are an abundant and fast-growing species that cause little devastation or destruction of biodiversity when cut down.

## Do you have any new ideas in the design process that we might see in the near future?

Yes, we are constantly developing products and ideas and are planning to launch a **horizontal surfboard wall hanger** that is much like our snowboard hangers. We also have a **"tip up" surfboard hanger** in the making, but it's a really tricky one to launch because of the different exit rockers in surfboards. It needs to be adjustable, so we are working on that, but haven't landed on an ultra-simple user-friendly solution yet.

We are also working on ideas and solutions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we are very early in the process. The goal is to develop products in a highly responsible and sustainable way contributing to make the world to be a better place for everyone.

## How is the surf scene in Toronto and what are your favourite spots?

The surf scene in **Toronto is pretty good from August to April**. When I say pretty good, I mean "there are waves". Maybe not what most people would think are good waves, but there are lots of them, like lots of them! every **6-8 seconds**! Surfing on a lake for the most part is like going into battle, you need to work for your waves. If an ocean surfer is looking for training, come surf a lake! You will gain strength and stamina very fast, and will probably get pretty frustrated with conditions.

The secret of the Great Lakes is to work your way through **forecasting and timing and knowing the spots**. I've been surfing the lakes for around 15 years and I've got that part down. I have 2-3 spots on each lake that I frequent and for the most part I see all the guys I've been sharing waves with for the past decade at these spots.

Nowadays, there are not so many secret spots left and most good spots could look like Huntington Pier on a good day. There are a few secret spots left that are sacred, they might take 5 hours to drive to, but it’s worth it every time! It's great driving right up to the wave and seeing clean, long empty waves with 2 or 3 of your crew already ripping.
