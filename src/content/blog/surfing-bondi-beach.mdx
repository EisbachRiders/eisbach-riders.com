Bondi beach is one of the most iconic beaches in Australia known for its unique flair, and the first time I visited Sydney I almost missed it. It was the last evening of a four month adventure around the continent and I wanted to watch the sunset on the beach. I went to Bondi Beach and spent the evening just sitting in the sand, mezmorized by the surf and sunset. It was eariler on this trip that I had tried surfing for the first time and I was completely hooked. That evening I promised myself I would come back to that beach day surf those waves.

In September 2019 I was lucky enough to get that chance. I could only stay in Sydney for two nights but this time I didn’t waste any time before I hightailed it directly to Bondi Beach. I wanted as much time on that beach as I could get. If you have the opportunity to travel to Sydney, I cannot recommend enough giving the waves here a try. Especially for beginners, there are a ton of options to learn to surf here. Be warned, the beach is also known for being extremely busy and crowded, but hey, that’s half the magic to be caught up in all the excitement! To make your trip a little easier, here are some of my tips.

### Getting There

<sub>Bondi Beach</sub>

You can reach Bondi Beach by taking public transport to Bondi Junction. From there you can take a short bus ride to the beach but if it’s possible for you, I would recommend walking instead. It takes about 20 minutes but is worth the chance to slow down and take it all in.

### Surf Schools and Rentals

<sub>Bondi Icebergs Club</sub>

Bondi beach is famous for the Icebergs Club with it’s swimming pool right next to the ocean. If you just need a locker and a shower, you can find these accommodations at the beach club house.

I rented a board and wetsuit at [Bondi Surf Co](http://www.bondisurfco.net.au "Surf Shop Bondi Beach Sydney"), a great local surf shop. At 20\$ per hour for both, it was a great deal and I was really happy with the experience.

Alternatively, if you are looking for lessons I would recommend a surf school located on the west side of the beach called [Lets go surfing](http://www.letsgosurfing.com.au "Surf School Let's go surfing Bondi beach Sydney"). There you can book surf lessons starting from 85 $ for a 2-hour beginners class. Board rental starts from 20$ per hour and board and wetsuit at 25\$.

### The spot

Bondi beach is a beach break that can be surfed any time of the year. The ideal swell direction is from the south. Grundswells and windswells are in eual measure. Best time is at mid tide when the tide is rising, lefts and rights are offered.

Current swell and conditions can be found on [Magic Seeweed](https://de.magicseaweed.com/Sydney-Bondi-Surf-Report/996/ "Magic Seaweed Bondi Beach Swell Report").

After you have finished surfing you can enjoy a flat white in one of the numerous beach cafes around Hall street.

Good swell!
