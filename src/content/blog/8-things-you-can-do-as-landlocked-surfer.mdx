During the time we are writing this, many European countries are being asked to stay home due to the COVID 19 virus. This extends to the Eisbach in Munich and public beaches in Spain, Italy, Portugal and France.

While we fully agree with this stance and want to do everything we can to flatten the curve, we totally get it, we also run the risk of cabin fever! So we gathered to some ideas that we are doing to help maintain our mental health.

## 1. Surf workouts

There are so many great exercise you can do at home to train for surfing! Yoga and other balance or core excercises are amazing for surfing. Another fun alternative is a balance board or a slackline (Feeling crafty? You can follow the DIY instructions from [Barley & Birch](https://barleyandbirch.com/2017/05/make-diy-balance-board-future-surfers/) to make your own balance board!).

• Cris Mills from Surf Strength Coach is one we have found that shows you some yoga-inspired exercises you could do easily at home within 10 minutes each day.

## 2. Repair your surfboard

Now is the perfect time to get your board ready for the next surf. Repair your board or change your broken fins. For smaller dings you can use resin in tube, such as [Phix](https://amzn.to/2wJa4aY) or [Solarez](https://amzn.to/2UO3Df3), which is super easy to apply. Bigger dings, such as a broken nose, require additional materials, we recommend checking out [Big Ding Box](https://amzn.to/3dBEuwD).

If you are looking for some new fins, leashes or wax, check out [our shop](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com).

## 3. Hang your surfboard

Just because your board isn't being used, doesn't mean it has to be hidden away! Wooden hooks are a wonderful and practical solution to storing your board. They are easy to use, make your board easily accessible and they look great too! There are couple of solutions to can store your surfboard while it isn't used. If you intend to use your board on a daily basis, the wooden hooks from [COR Surf](https://amzn.to/2UWCZjT) are a stylish option.

For your best board from your quiver, a more prestige solution might be the better fit. The [SHEPPS GNARWALL surfboard wall](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/surfboard-wall-rack/) mount is the only fully concealed surfboard rack on the market. Made from ecological materials, the holder is produced in Canada and puts your board in the spotlight.
