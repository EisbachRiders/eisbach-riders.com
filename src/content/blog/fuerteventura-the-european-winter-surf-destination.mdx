It was that annoying time inbetween seasons when temperatures drop to zero degrees and yet there was still no sign of snow in the mountains when we decided it was time to escape the short days in Munich and go somewhere warm. The Canary Islands make the perfect destination, the islands are just 4.5 hours away by plane and offer all year sunshine and guaranteed swell during the winter months.

## Weather

The best time to visit Fuerteventura is from October to April, however, keep in mind that during the holiday season it can get crowded. Due to its location, Fuerte receives swell and wind from all directions. During the winter you can enjoy consistent swell and air temperatures a little over 20°C. You probably want to pack a 3/2 wetsuit as the water is still above 18°C.

## Where to go

The northern towns of Corralejo, Cotillio or Lajares are the best base for a winter surf trip. Corralejo is more touristic with lots of hotels, restaurants and nightlife, while Cotillio and Lajares are more laidback and cater to the surf nomads with several surf shops, organic cuisine and close proximity to the island’s best breaks. This time we stayed close to Cotillio in El Roque in a lovely AirBnB. As we were just visiting for a couple of days, we didn’t bother to bring our own boards and found a great selection of soft boards, shortboards and longboards for a reasonable price at Riders Surf'N Bike in Cotillio.

## The surf spots

To get around and explore the spots, a car is a great investment. The distances between the beaches and towns are short but the roads are mostly bumpy dirt roads so keep that in mind when renting a car – SUP might be the better option. Make sure to grab one of the free surf maps which you can get at any surf school or shop.

The beach break in Cotillio is suited for all surf levels as well as wind and kitesurfing, which means it is mostly pretty windy here. Unfortunately, there are no restrooms, showers or bars close to the beach so make sure to plan ahead and bring some snacks.

Surf spots north of Lajares, such as Majanicho, are more rocky and cater to intermediate to advanced surfers with long point breaks that break over a mixture of sand and rock.

There's a lot more surf waiting here, so we'll be back!

Until next time! Michael
