The first time I went to Australia was back in 2014. I spent 4 months travelling pretty much all over Australia with the youthful goal of freedom and adventures. Not only was this the trip of a lifetime, it was was also the first time when I tried surfing. I was on a student's budget and I wanted to spend my money for all the fun activities I always stayed in Hostels. One of my principles was to always ask for the cheapest room.

###**Port Maqcuarie**

On my way from Sydney towards Brisbane I stopped in Port Macquarie and stayed at [Beachside Backpackers](https://prf.hn/l/6knPo3r "Beachside Backpackers"). In my opinion this was one of the best Hostels in entire Australia. Port Maquarie is famous for bodyboarding and also known as the bodyboard capital of Australia. (link: https://pmba.com.au) Beside Bodyboarding Port Macquarie has 4 main beaches. On the lighthouse beach you can also ride camels.

###**My first ride**

In the Hostel I meet John and Jess who are friend of the Hostel owner Nicael. I told them that I want to learn surfing but didn’t want to go to a surf camp so they showed me the surf boards and chose a soft board for me. The Hostel owns some surfboard and it is free for rent as long as you not break them. We drove to the beach and Jess gave me a short introduction on the beach how to stand up. Then we went into the white wash. It doesn’t took me long the catch the first wave and I was driving crazy. This feeling was unbelievable. I will never forget. Jess and me stayed in the white wash. Nicael and John surfed outside with some dolphins. Even I hit a rock and my elbow was bleeding it didn’t stopped from surfing. What an amazing feeling.

###**Surf Spots**

Waves can be found with swells from the south to east with offshore north-west winds through to south-east winds.

This beach has a protected northern corner that handles north to north-east swell.

**Cathie Beach**

Cvathie beach is an open beach further south, which can offer powerful waves with south to east swell.

**Rainbow Beach**

Rainbow Beach has righthander point break and beach breaks. Grants Headland picks up the smallest of swells and is best in the north-east swell with west to north-east winds.

**North Heaven**

This beach offers beach breaks with the best waves south to east swell, and works best with west to south-east winds. The bar can hand out some large waves but tidal flow from the river affects the wave quality.

If you are not sure which spot is on, you can simply ask the guys from the Hostel.
