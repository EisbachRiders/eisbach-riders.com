# From the basement back to the beach!

Today we want to introduce you to an initiative called **Provide the Slide** from Bern, Switzerland. What started out as a simple surf trip for Simon and Christopher to Liberia in the summer of 2019 ended up launching a global project to upcycle unused surf boards.

The goal of Provide the Slide is to help spread the joy of surfing to those in other countries who aren’t able to afford their own equipment. Together with friends, right now they collect used surfboards from Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Spain and ship them to the local surf community in Liberia. Learn more about their inspiring story on their [website](https://providetheslide.com/uber-uns).

## Do you have a board in your basement?

So far, they have collected **over 100 boards** for their next shipment in May 2020. If you want to donate your board, leashes or fins, you can [contact them here](https://providetheslide.com/). The next destination and collection phase are already in the planning.

Don't have a board and still want to help? **[Share their story!](https://www.instagram.com/providetheslide/)**

We love the idea of giving back to the community and went through our old boards as well. We decided to contribute a board and a couple of fins and leashes to support the Liberian surf community.
