In this piece of our Product Insights, we would like to introduce our partner, Bee Swell. We discovered the **handmade organic bee wax** in 2018 and totally fall in love with the story behind the brand. In the following guest article, Nikki Macredes, founder of **Bee Swell**, will tell us a bit more about Bee Swell.

## The start of Bee Swell

I started Bee Swell in 2016 because I wanted to help make a difference. I knew that I had a greater purpose that went far beyond being a mom and a wife. I noticed that every year there seemed to be more and more bee colonies lost, and I wanted to help reverse that problem. Knowing that bees make life as we know it possible, I had to help!

One out of every three bites of food we eat is because of bees. The cotton for our clothes, alfalfa for animals, and so much more! When I first started this company I simply started by helping to raise awareness. I sold shirts that said “Bee Swell Save the Bees” and just tried to educate however I could. Within about 6 months my plan changed a bit. My love for bees grew on a more personal level as I would nurse them back to life after finding them dying on the sidewalks. That was when I decided that I wanted to start my own rescue mission.

## On the road to create a pollinator sanctuary

We are still working towards our ultimate goal of creating a pollinator sanctuary, but right now proceeds from sales help us to provide pollinator habitat as well as boxes to put rescued bees in. Instead of letting bee swarms be sprayed and killed, I go out to collect them, and then give them a safe home where they can thrive.

## Handmade organic surf wax

Part of Bee Swell is “making a difference”...and I incorporate this into everything we sell. We know that surf wax is used all around the world and we wanted to help bring a natural, eco- friendly, reef safe product to the table. We are so excited that we have created a product that is loved and used by so many people that want to make a difference as well. Our wax is made with organic ingredients and ethically sourced local beeswax. Currently we have two waxes available, but we are in test phase for our next wax and we can’t wait to launch!

The [Hana Hou Tropical/Base wax](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/handmade-surf-wax/) helps to provide long lasting bumps on your board giving you added grip. Because the main ingredient is beeswax, this wax has a higher melting point and really stays put on your board...not to mention it smells amazing! If you are a river or wake surfer then throw some of [Grip-Bee wax](https://shop.eisbach-riders.com/shop/handmade-surf-wax/) over the top for some seriously sticky grip! All of the bee swell waxes should be applied to a clean board for the first time. You can reapply if needed, but depending on how long your session is...you should be able to get multiple sessions out of one application.
