between a consumer or a\n        trader (hereinafter referred to as \"Client”) and the Seller relating to\n        all goods and/or services presented in the Seller's online shop. The\n        inclusion of the Client’s own conditions is herewith objected to, unless\n        other terms have been stipulated.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        1.2 A consumer pursuant to these Terms and Conditions is any natural\n        person concluding a legal transaction for a purpose attributed neither\n        to a mainly commercial nor a self-employed occupational activity. A\n        trader pursuant to these Terms and Conditions is any natural or legal\n        person or partnership with legal capacity acting in the performance of a\n        commercial or self-employed occupational activity when concluding a\n        legal transaction.\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        1.3 Digital content in the sense of these General Terms and Conditions\n        are all data not on a tangible medium which are produced in digital form\n        and are supplied by the Seller by granting certain usage rights\n        precisely defined in these General Terms and Conditions.\n      </Typography>\n\n      <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\">2) Conclusion of the Contract</Typography>\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        2.1 The product descriptions in the Seller’s online shop do not\n        constitute binding offers on the part of the Seller, but merely serve\n        the purpose of submitting a binding offer by the Client.\n      </Typography>\n\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        2.2 The Client may submit the offer via the online order form integrated\n        into the Seller's online shop. In doing so, after having placed the\n        selected goods and/or services in the virtual basket and passed through\n        the ordering process, and by clicking the button finalizing the order\n        process, the Client submits a legally binding offer of contract with\n        regard to the goods and/or services contained in the shopping cart.\n      </Typography>\n\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        2.3 The Seller may accept the Client’s offer within five days, - by\n        transferring a written order confirmation or an order confirmation in\n        written form (fax or e-mail); insofar receipt of order confirmation by\n        the Client is decisive, or - by delivering ordered goods to the Client;\n        insofar receipt of goods by the customer is decisive, or - by requesting\n        the Client to pay after he placed his order. Provided that several of\n        the aforementioned alternatives apply, the contract shall be concluded\n        at the time when one of the aforementioned alternatives firstly occurs.\n        Should the Seller not accept the Client’s offer within the\n        aforementioned period of time, this shall be deemed as rejecting the\n        offer with the effect that the Client is no longer bound by his\n        statement of intent.\n      </Typography>\n\n      <Typography className={classes.text}>\n        2.4 When submitting an offer via the Seller's online order form, the\n        text of the contract is stored by the Seller after the contract has been\n        concluded and transmitted to the Client in text form (e.g. e-mail, fax\n        or letter) after the order has been sent.

The enlargement function of the\n        browser to enlarge the display on the screen may be an effective method\n        for better recognizing input errors.
