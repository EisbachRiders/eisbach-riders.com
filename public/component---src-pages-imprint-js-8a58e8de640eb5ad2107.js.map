When you visit our website, we collect the\r\n        following data that is technically necessary for us to display the\r\n        website to you: - Our visited website - Date and time at the moment of\r\n        access - Amount of data sent in bytes - Source/reference from which you\r\n        came to the page - Browser used - Operating system used - IP address\r\n        used (if applicable: in anonymized form) Data processing is carried out\r\n        in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR on the basis of our\r\n        legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our\r\n        website. The data will not be passed on or used in any other way.\r\n        However, we reserve the right to check the server log files\r\n        subsequently, if there are any concrete indications of illegal use. 3)\r\n        Cookies In order to make your visit to our website attractive and to\r\n        enable the use of certain functions, we use so-called cookies on various\r\n        pages. These are small text files that are stored on your end device.\r\n        Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser\r\n        session, i.e. after closing your browser (so-called session cookies).\r\n        Other cookies remain on your terminal and enable us or our partner\r\n        companies (third-party cookies) to recognize your browser on your next\r\n        visit (persistent cookies). If cookies are set, they collect and process\r\n        specific user information such as browser and location data as well as\r\n        IP address values according to individual requirements. Persistent\r\n        cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may\r\n        vary depending on the cookie. In some cases, cookies are used to\r\n        simplify the ordering process by saving settings (e.g. remembering the\r\n        content of a virtual shopping basket for a later visit to the website).\r\n        If personal data are also processed by individual cookies set by us, the\r\n        processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR\r\n        either for the execution of the contract or in accordance with Art. 6\r\n        (1) point f GDPR to safeguard our legitimate interests in the best\r\n        possible functionality of the website and a customer-friendly and\r\n        effective design of the page visit. We work together with advertising\r\n        partners who help us to make our website more interesting for you. For\r\n        this purpose, cookies from partner companies are also stored on your\r\n        hard drive when you visit our website (third-party cookies). You will be\r\n        informed individually and separately about the use of such cookies and\r\n        the scope of the information collected in each case within the following\r\n        sections. Please note that you can set your browser in such a way that\r\n        you are informed about the setting of cookies and you can decide\r\n        individually about their acceptance or exclude the acceptance of cookies\r\n        for certain cases or generally. Each browser differs in the way it\r\n        manages the cookie settings. This is described in the help menu of each\r\n        browser, which explains how you can change your cookie settings. You\r\n        will find these for the respective browsers under the following links: -\r\n        Internet Explorer:\r\n        https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies\r\n        - Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/websites/#cookies -\r\n        Chrome:\r\n        https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en\r\n        - Safari:\r\n        https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac\r\n        - Opera: https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies\r\n        Please note that the functionality of our website may be limited if\r\n        cookies are not accepted. 4) Contacting Us When you contact us (e.g. via\r\n        contact form or e-mail), personal data is collected. Which data is\r\n        collected in the case of a contact form can be seen from the respective\r\n        contact form. These data are stored and used exclusively for the purpose\r\n        of responding to your request or for establishing contact and for the\r\n        associated technical administration. The legal basis for processing data\r\n        is our legitimate interest in responding to your request in accordance\r\n        with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR. If your contact is aimed at concluding a\r\n        contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1)\r\n        point b GDPR. Your data will be deleted after final processing of your\r\n        enquiry; this is the case if it can be inferred from the circumstances\r\n        that the facts in question have been finally clarified, provided that\r\n        there are no legal storage obligations to the contrary. 5) Data\r\n        Processing When Opening a Customer Account and for Contract Processing\r\n        Pursuant to Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR, personal data will continue to be\r\n        collected and processed if you provide them to us for the execution of a\r\n        contract or when opening a customer account. Which data is collected can\r\n        be seen from the respective input forms. It is possible to delete your\r\n        customer account at any time. This can be done by sending a message to\r\n        the above-mentioned address of the controller. We store and use the data\r\n        provided by you for contract processing. After complete processing of\r\n        the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be\r\n        blocked in consideration of tax and commercial retention periods and\r\n        deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly\r\n        consented to further use of your data or a legally permitted further use\r\n        of data has been reserved by our site, about which we will inform you\r\n        accordingly below. 6) Use of Your Data for Direct Advertising 6.1 If you\r\n        subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular information\r\n        about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending the\r\n        newsletter is your e-mail address. The indication of additional possible\r\n        data is voluntary and is used to be able to address you personally. We\r\n        use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the newsletter.\r\n        This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter, unless you\r\n        have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of the\r\n        newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to\r\n        confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking on an\r\n        appropriate link. By activating the confirmation link, you give us your\r\n        consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1)\r\n        point a GDPR. When you register for the newsletter, we store your IP\r\n        address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the\r\n        date and time of registration so that we can trace any possible misuse\r\n        of your e-mail address at a later time. The data collected by us when\r\n        you register for the newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose\r\n        of advertising by means of the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the\r\n        newsletter at any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by\r\n        sending a message to the responsible person named above. After your\r\n        cancellation, your e-mail address will immediately be deleted from our\r\n        newsletter distribution list, unless you have expressly consented to\r\n        further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data in excess\r\n        thereof, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this\r\n        declaration. 6.2 Our e-mail newsletters are sent via the technical\r\n        service provider, The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, 675\r\n        Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA\r\n        (https://mailchimp.com), to whom we pass on the data you provided when\r\n        registering for the newsletter. This disclosure is made in accordance\r\n        with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR and serves our legitimate interest in the\r\n        use of an effective, secure and user-friendly newsletter system. Please\r\n        note that your data is usually transferred to a MailChimp server in the\r\n        USA and stored there. MailChimp uses this information to send and\r\n        statistically evaluate the newsletter on our behalf. For evaluation\r\n        purposes, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking\r\n        pixels, which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website.\r\n        This allows us to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened\r\n        and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information\r\n        is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and\r\n        operating system). The data are collected exclusively in a pseudonymized\r\n        format and are not linked with other personal data from you. A direct\r\n        personal relationship is excluded. This data is used exclusively for\r\n        statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these\r\n        analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests\r\n        of the recipients. If you wish to object to the data analysis for\r\n        statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the\r\n        newsletter. Furthermore, MailChimp can use this data according to Art. 6\r\n        (1) point f GDPR even on the basis of its own legitimate interest in the\r\n        demand-oriented design and optimization of the service as well as for\r\n        market research purposes, for example to determine from which countries\r\n        recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our\r\n        newsletter recipients to address those recipients or pass that data on\r\n        to third parties. To protect your data in the USA, we have concluded a\r\n        data processing agreement (\"Data-Processing-Agreement\") with MailChimp\r\n        on the basis of the standard contractual clauses of the European\r\n        Commission to enable the transmission of your personal data to\r\n        MailChimp. If you are interested in viewing this data processing\r\n        agreement, you can do so at the following Internet link:\r\n        https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/ MailChimp\r\n        is also certified under the US-European data protection agreement\r\n        \"Privacy Shield\" and thus undertakes to comply with EU data protection\r\n        regulations. The data protection regulations of MailChimp can be viewed\r\n        at: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/ 7) Processing of Data for the\r\n        Purpose of Order Handling 7.1 The personal data collected by us will be\r\n        passed on to the transport company commissioned with the delivery within\r\n        the scope of contract processing, insofar as this is necessary for the\r\n        delivery of the goods. We will pass on your payment data to the\r\n        commissioned credit institution within the framework of payment\r\n        processing, if this is necessary for payment handling. If payment\r\n        service providers are used, we explicitly inform you of this below. The\r\n        legal basis for the transfer of data is Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR. 7.2 Use\r\n        of Special Service Providers for Order Processing and Handling - Billbee\r\n        Orders are processed by the service provider \"Billbee\" (Billbee GmbH,\r\n        Paulinenstrasse 54, 32756 Detmold). Name, address and, if applicable,\r\n        other personal data will be passed on to Billbee exclusively for\r\n        processing the online order in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR.\r\n        Your data will only be passed on if this is actually necessary for\r\n        processing the order. Details regarding Billbee's privacy policy and\r\n        Billbee's privacy policy can be found on Billbee's website at:\r\n        https://www.billbee.io/datenschutz/ 7.3 Use of Payment Service Providers\r\n        - Paypal When you pay via PayPal, credit card via PayPal, direct debit\r\n        via PayPal or - if offered - \"purchase on account\" or \"payment by\r\n        instalments\" via PayPal, we transmit your payment data to PayPal\r\n        (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449\r\n        Luxembourg (hereinafter \"PayPal\"). The transfer takes place in\r\n        accordance with Art. 6 (1) point b GDPR and only insofar as this is\r\n        necessary for payment processing. PayPal reserves the right to carry out\r\n        credit checks for the payment methods credit card via PayPal, direct\r\n        debit via PayPal or, if offered, \"purchase on account\" or \"payment by\r\n        installments\" via PayPal. For this purpose, your payment data may be\r\n        passed on to credit agencies on the basis of PayPal's legitimate\r\n        interest in determining your solvency pursuant to Art. 6 (1) point f\r\n        GDPR. PayPal uses the result of the credit assessment in relation to the\r\n        statistical probability of non-payment for the purpose of deciding on\r\n        the provision of the respective payment method. The credit report can\r\n        contain probability values (so-called score values). If score values are\r\n        included in the result of the credit report, they are based on\r\n        recognized scientific, mathematical-statistical methods. The calculation\r\n        of the score values includes, but is not limited to, address data. For\r\n        further information on data protection law, including the credit\r\n        agencies used, please refer to PayPal's data protection declaration at:\r\n        https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full. You can object to\r\n        this processing of your data at any time by sending a message to PayPal.\r\n        However, PayPal may still be entitled to process your personal data if\r\n        this is necessary for contractual payment processing. 8) Web Analysis\r\n        Services Google (Universal) Analytics - Google Analytics This website\r\n        uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google LLC, 1600\r\n        Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\"Google\"). Google\r\n        Analytics uses so-called cookies, which are text files stored on your\r\n        computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The\r\n        information generated by the cookies about your use of this website\r\n        (including the shortened IP address) is generally transmitted to a\r\n        Google server in the USA and stored there. This website uses Google\r\n        Analytics exclusively with the extension \"_anonymizeIp()\", which ensures\r\n        an anonymization of the IP address by shortening it and excludes a\r\n        direct personal relationship. As a result of the extension, your IP\r\n        address will previously be shortened by Google within member states of\r\n        the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the\r\n        European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP\r\n        address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened\r\n        there. In these exceptional cases, processing is carried out in\r\n        accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR, on the basis of our legitimate\r\n        interest in the statistical analysis of user behavior for optimization\r\n        and marketing purposes. On our behalf, Google will use this information\r\n        to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website\r\n        activity and to provide us with other services relating to website and\r\n        internet use.

This is regardless of whether Google provides a user\r\n        account that you are logged in with or whether no user account exists.\r\n        If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly\r\n        associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with\r\n        your profile on Google, you must log out before activating the button.\r\n        Google saves your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage\r\n        profiles and evaluates them. Such an evaluation takes place according to\r\n        Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR, on the basis of the legitimate interests of\r\n        Google in the insertion of personalized advertising, market research\r\n        and/or demand-oriented design of its website. You have the right to\r\n        object to the creation of these user profiles. If you want to do so, you\r\n        must contact Google to exercise this right. Google LLC, based in the\r\n        United States, is certified for the US-European data protection\r\n        agreement \"Privacy Shield\", which guarantees compliance with the data\r\n        protection level applicable in the EU. If you do not agree to the future\r\n        transmission of your data to Google in the context of using Google Maps,\r\n        you may completely deactivate the Google Maps web service by switching\r\n        off the JavaScript application in your browser.

Alternative dispute\r\n        resolution 1) Scope of Application 1.1 These General Terms and\r\n        Conditions of the company Eisbach Riders, Robin Eisenhardt & Michael\r\n        Schmidt GbR (hereinafter referred to as \"Seller”) shall apply to all\r\n        contracts concluded between a consumer or a trader (hereinafter referred\r\n        to as \"Client”) and the Seller relating to all goods and/or services\r\n        presented in the Seller's online shop. The inclusion of the Client’s own\r\n        conditions is herewith objected to, unless other terms have been\r\n        stipulated. 1.2 A consumer pursuant to these Terms and Conditions is any\r\n        natural person concluding a legal transaction for a purpose attributed\r\n        neither to a mainly commercial nor a self-employed occupational\r\n        activity. A trader pursuant to these Terms and Conditions is any natural\r\n        or legal person or partnership with legal capacity acting in the\r\n        performance of a commercial or self-employed occupational activity when\r\n        concluding a legal transaction. 1.3 Digital content in the sense of\r\n        these General Terms and Conditions are all data not on a tangible medium\r\n        which are produced in digital form and are supplied by the Seller by\r\n        granting certain usage rights precisely defined in these General Terms\r\n        and Conditions. 2) Conclusion of the Contract 2.1 The product\r\n        descriptions in the Seller’s online shop do not constitute binding\r\n        offers on the part of the Seller, but merely serve the purpose of\r\n        submitting a binding offer by the Client. 2.2 The Client may submit the\r\n        offer via the online order form integrated into the Seller's online\r\n        shop. In doing so, after having placed the selected goods and/or\r\n        services in the virtual basket and passed through the ordering process,\r\n        and by clicking the button finalizing the order process, the Client\r\n        submits a legally binding offer of contract with regard to the goods\r\n        and/or services contained in the shopping cart. 2.3 The Seller may\r\n        accept the Client’s offer within five days, - by transferring a written\r\n        order confirmation or an order confirmation in written form (fax or\r\n        e-mail); insofar receipt of order confirmation by the Client is\r\n        decisive, or - by delivering ordered goods to the Client; insofar\r\n        receipt of goods by the customer is decisive, or - by requesting the\r\n        Client to pay after he placed his order. Provided that several of the\r\n        aforementioned alternatives apply, the contract shall be concluded at\r\n        the time when one of the aforementioned alternatives firstly occurs.\r\n        Should the Seller not accept the Client’s offer within the\r\n        aforementioned period of time, this shall be deemed as rejecting the\r\n        offer with the effect that the Client is no longer bound by his\r\n        statement of intent. 2.4 When submitting an offer via the Seller's\r\n        online order form, the text of the contract is stored by the Seller\r\n        after the contract has been concluded and transmitted to the Client in\r\n        text form (e.g. e-mail, fax or letter) after the order has been sent.\r\n        The seller shall not make the contract text accessible beyond this. 2.5\r\n        Prior to submitting a binding order via the Seller’s online order form,\r\n        the Client may recognize input errors by reading attentively the\r\n        information displayed on the screen. The enlargement function of the\r\n        browser to enlarge the display on the screen may be an effective method\r\n        for better recognizing input errors. The Client can correct all the data\r\n        entered via the usual keyboard and mouse function during the electronic\r\n        ordering process, until he clicks the button finalizing the ordering\r\n        process. 2.6 The German language is exclusively available for the\r\n        conclusion of the contract. 2.7 Order processing and contacting usually\r\n        takes place via e-mail and automated order processing. It is the\r\n        Client’s responsibility to ensure that the e-mail address he provides\r\n        for the order processing is accurate so that e-mails sent by the Seller\r\n        can be received at this address. Particularly, it is the Client`s\r\n        responsibility, if SPAM filters are used, to ensure that all e-mails\r\n        sent by the Seller or by third parties commissioned by the Seller with\r\n        the order processing can be delivered. 3) Right to Cancel 3.1 Consumers\r\n        are entitled to the right to cancel. 3.2 Detailed informations about the\r\n        right to cancel are provided in the Seller’s instruction on\r\n        cancellation. 4) Prices and Payment Conditions 4.1 Unless otherwise\r\n        stated in the Seller’s product description, prices indicated are total\r\n        prices including the statutory sales tax. Delivery costs, where\r\n        appropriate, will be indicated separately in the respective product\r\n        description 4.2 Payment can be made using one of the methods mentioned\r\n        in the Seller’s online shop. 4.3 If prepayment by bank transfer has been\r\n        agreed upon, payment is due immediately after conclusion of the\r\n        contract, unless the parties have arranged a later maturity date 4.4\r\n        When payments are made using a payment method offered by PayPal,\r\n        handling of payments takes place via the payment service provider PayPal\r\n        ((Europe) S.a. r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449\r\n        Luxembourg (hereinafter called “PayPal”) subject to the PayPal terms of\r\n        use which can be viewed at:\r\n        https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full. In case the\r\n        client has no PayPal account, the conditions applicable for payments\r\n        without PayPal account will be effective. They can be viewed at:\r\n        https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacywax-full 5) Shipment and\r\n        Delivery Conditions 5.1 Goods are generally delivered on dispatch route\r\n        and to the delivery address indicated by the Client, unless agreed\r\n        otherwise. During the processing of the transaction, the delivery\r\n        address indicated in the Seller’s order processing is decisive. However,\r\n        in case the Client selects the payment method PayPal, the delivery\r\n        address deposited with PayPal at the date of payment shall be decisive.\r\n        5.2 Should the assigned transport company return the goods to the\r\n        Seller, because delivery to the Client was not possible, the Client\r\n        bears the costs for the unsuccessful dispatch. This shall not apply, if\r\n        the Client exercises his right to cancel effectively, if the delivery\r\n        cannot be made due to circumstances beyond the Client's control or if he\r\n        has been temporarily impeded to receive the offered service, unless the\r\n        Seller has notified the Client about the service for a reasonable time\r\n        in advance. 5.3 Personal collection is not possible for logistical\r\n        reasons. 6) Reservation of Proprietary Rights If the Seller provides\r\n        advance deliveries, he retains title of ownership to the delivered\r\n        goods, until the purchase price owed has been paid in full. 7) Warranty\r\n        7.1 Should the object of purchase be deficient, statutory provisions\r\n        shall apply. 7.2 Deviating hereof regarding used goods: Claims for\r\n        defects are excluded if the defect does not occur until one year after\r\n        delivery of the goods. Defects that occur within one year of delivery of\r\n        the goods can be asserted within the statutory limitation period. The\r\n        shortening of the limitation period does not apply, - for a product,\r\n        which was not used, in accordance with its usual application, for\r\n        building construction and which was the cause of the building's\r\n        defectiveness, - for claims for damages and reimbursement of expenses on\r\n        the part of the Client, and - if the Seller has fraudulently concealed\r\n        the defect. 7.3 The Client is asked to notify any obvious transport\r\n        damages to the forwarding agent and to inform the Seller accordingly.\r\n        Should the Client fail to comply therewith, this shall not affect his\r\n        statutory or contractual claims for defects. 8) Applicable Law The law\r\n        of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply to all legal\r\n        relationships between the parties under exclusion of the laws governing\r\n        the international purchase of movable goods. For consumers, this choice\r\n        of law only applies to the extent that the granted protection is not\r\n        withdrawn by mandatory provisions of the law of the country, in which\r\n        the consumer has his habitual residence. 9) Alternative dispute\r\n        resolution 9.1 The EU Commission provides on its website the following\r\n        link to the ODR platform: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. This\r\n        platform shall be a point of entry for out-of-court resolutions of\r\n        disputes arising from online sales and service contracts concluded\r\n        between consumers and traders. 9.2 The Seller is neither obliged nor\r\n        prepared to attend a dispute settlement procedure before an alternative\r\n        dispute resolution entity.\r\n        ------------------------------------------------- Instructions for\r\n        cancellation & Cancellation form\r\n        ------------------------------------------------- Consumers, i.e. any\r\n        individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside those\r\n        individual’s trade, business, craft or profession, are entitled to\r\n        cancel any contract on the following conditions:\r\n        -------------------------------- A.
